# Movie-Recommendation-System-using-KNN-K-Nearest-Neighbors-and-CF-Collaborative-Filtering-
Built a movie recommendation system using KNN and collaborative filtering on the MovieLens dataset. Performed EDA to analyze sparsity, implemented unweighted and weighted KNN, and user-based CF using cosine similarity. Compared models using RMSE, with weighted KNN achieving the best accuracy.
